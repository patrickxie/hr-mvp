 let slugName, rawJson, isSolu, topicList;

need more error handling for promise chains

new model

title-slug: title-slug for the post
post-title
unparsed solutions: json
parsed solutions& formatted: json
commentsRaw: get it from tid

get the topic id
https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/${topic_id}/

this json will contain the array of all the answers with <code></code> in them, save the ones with code tag

todo next: parse and format
try  & catch when parse format

authenticate
split the python code string 
paste into web, hit submit
